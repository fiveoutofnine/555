# We initialize `data` to bitpack the location data together where the day #
# corresponds to the bit position. Since there are 16 unique cities, we can
# safely reserve 4 bits to store each day's location (2**4 = 16). See
# {FiveFiveFiveData.getDayLocation} to see the mapping of location values to
# cities. Since 1 character in hex is 4 bits, we can just construct a hex string
# by concatenating the hex values of each day's location.
